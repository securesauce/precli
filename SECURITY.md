# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes will be fixed on the latest major release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Precli is a tool designed to find security issues, so every effort is made that
it is also free of those issues. However, if you believe you have found a
security vulnerability in this repository please open it privately via the
[Report a security vulnerability](https://github.com/securesauce/precli/security/advisories/new)
link in the Issues tab.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues,
discussions, or pull requests.**
