============================================
Observable Timing Discrepancy in Hmac Module
============================================

Do not use Python's == operator to compare HMAC digests. The == operator is
not designed to be used for cryptographic comparisons, and it can be
vulnerable to timing attacks. Instead, use the hmac.compare_digest() function
to compare HMAC digests.

The == operator works by comparing the length and contents of two objects.
However, this can be a problem for HMAC digests, because the length of an
HMAC digest is not necessarily unique. For example, two different messages
with the same key will have the same HMAC digest.

A timing attack is a type of attack that exploits the time it takes to
execute a piece of code. In the case of HMAC digests, a timing attack could
be used to determine whether two messages have the same HMAC digest. This
could be used to break the security of an HMAC-protected system.

The hmac.compare_digest() function is designed to be used for cryptographic
comparisons. It works by comparing the binary representations of two HMAC
digests. This makes it more resistant to timing attacks.

-------
Example
-------

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 13

    import hmac


    received_digest = (
        b"\xe2\x93\x08\x19T8\xdc\x80\xef\x87\x90m\x1f\x9d\xf7\xf2"
        "\xf5\x10>\xdbf\xa2\xaf\xf7x\xcdX\xdf"
    )

    key = b"my-secret-key"
    password = b"pass"
    digest = hmac.digest(key, password, digest="sha224")

    return digest == received_digest

-----------
Remediation
-----------

The recommendation is to replace the == operator with the function
``compare_digest``.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 13

    import hmac


    received_digest = (
        b"\xe2\x93\x08\x19T8\xdc\x80\xef\x87\x90m\x1f\x9d\xf7\xf2"
        "\xf5\x10>\xdbf\xa2\xaf\xf7x\xcdX\xdf"
    )

    key = b"my-secret-key"
    password = b"pass"
    digest = hmac.digest(key, password, digest="sha224")

    return hmac.compare_digest(digest, received_digest)
