Reversible One Way Hash in Crypt Module
=======================================

The Python module ``crypt`` provides a number of functions for password
hashing. However, some of the hashing functions supported by ``crypt`` are weak
and should not be used. These weak hashing functions include ``CRYPT`` and
``MD5``.

The ``CRYPT`` hashing function is a weak hashing function because it is based
on a simple DES algorithm. This algorithm is relatively easy to crack, and
passwords hashed with crypt can be easily recovered by attackers.

The ``MD5`` hashing function is also a weak hashing function. MD5 is a
cryptographic hash function that was designed in the early 1990s. MD5 is
no longer considered secure, and passwords hashed with MD5 can be easily
cracked by attackers.

If using the crypt module, it is recommended to use more secure methods such
as ``SHA256`` and ``SHA512``.

--------
Examples
--------

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 4

    import crypt


    crypt.crypt("password", salt=crypt.METHOD_MD5)

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 4

    import crypt


    crypt.mksalt(crypt.METHOD_CRYPT)

-----------
Remediation
-----------

The recommendation is to swap the insecure hashing method to one of the more
secure alternatives, ``SHA256`` or ``SHA512``.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 4

    import crypt


    crypt.crypt("password", salt=crypt.METHOD_SHA256)

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 4

    import crypt


    crypt.mksalt(crypt.METHOD_SHA512)

---------------------
Alternatives to Crypt
---------------------

There are a number of alternatives to weak hashing functions. These
alternatives include ``bcrypt``, ``pbkdf2``, and ``scrypt``.

 - ``bcrypt`` is a secure password hashing function that is based on the
   Blowfish block cipher. Bcrypt is considered to be one of the most secure
   password hashing functions available.

 - ``PBKDF2`` is a secure password hashing function that is based on the HMAC
   cryptographic function. PBKDF2 is considered to be one of the most secure
   password hashing functions available.

 - ``scrypt`` is a secure password hashing function that is based on the bcrypt
   algorithm. Scrypt is designed to be more secure than bcrypt, and it is also
   more resistant to GPU-based attacks.
