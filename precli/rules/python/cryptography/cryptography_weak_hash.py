Reversible One Way Hash in Cryptography Module
==============================================

The Python module ``cryptography`` provides a number of functions for hashing
data. However, some of the hash algorithms supported by ``cryptography`` are
insecure and should not be used. These insecure hash algorithms include ``MD5``
and ``SHA1``.

The MD5 hash algorithm is a cryptographic hash function that was designed in
the early 1990s. MD5 is no longer considered secure, and passwords hashed with
MD5 can be easily cracked by attackers.

The SHA-1 hash algorithm is also a cryptographic hash function that was
designed in the early 1990s. SHA-1 is no longer considered secure, and
passwords hashed with SHA-1 can be easily cracked by attackers.

-------
Example
-------

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 4

    import cryptography


    cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hashes.MD5()

-----------
Remediation
-----------

The recommendation is to swap the insecure hashing method to one of the more
secure alternatives, ``SHA256`` or ``SHA512``.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 4

    import cryptography


    cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hashes.SHA256()
